        <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
        <p>
          No words will ever be enough to capture the depth of love and
          gratitude we hold for you. Sometimes we fall short in showing it, and
          our actions may not always reflect it perfectly—but please know this
          from the bottom of our hearts: without you, we are nothing
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve been our anchor, our guiding light, our quiet strength. The
          countless sacrifices you’ve made for Harini, the unconditional support
          you’ve poured into Rishi—it has shaped who we are in ways we’re only
          beginning to understand. You've given up your dreams to build ours,
          stood tall through storms just so we could feel safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, to see you finally returning to the work you’ve always
          loved—the passion you set aside for us—it brings a peace to our hearts
          that words can’t explain. You deserve this joy, Amma. You’ve earned
          every moment of it a thousand times over
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone in the family says, “These three are a team.” And they’re
          right. We are. We always have been, and we always will be. No matter
          what comes, we’ll hold each other up, walk side by side, and love each
          other fiercely.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love you, Amma. With all that we are.
          <br />
          We love you 3000. ❤️💖
        </p>
